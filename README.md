# Swifty Portfolio

Almost two years ago, after 5+ years [in Web Development](https://github.com/BrianSipple), I made the leap into Swift and Apple-platforms development.

This repo is meant to showcase the endeavors that comprise the substrate of those skillz (so far).

If you're looking for an experienced, **remote-based** software engineer who's been diving deep into SwiftUI, Combine, and iOS 13 since WWDC (and who welcomes being paid in Bitcoin üôÇ), please feel free to [reach out](mailto:CypherPoet@gmail.com) ‚úåÔ∏è.

# ‚ö°Ô∏è Production Apps

## [Satoshi VS](https://cypherpoet.github.io/SatoshiVS-iOS/)

Built with SwiftUI to visualize the value of Satoshis against a wide selection of other currencies.
