# Swifty Portfolio

_A handy portfolio of endeavors that have been the substrate for my skillz as a Swift/iOS/Apple-platforms engineer_.

(You can also check out some of the [Web development-related stuff](https://github.com/BrianSipple) I've done if you really want to (But do you really want to? üòõ)).

## 100 Days of Swift / Hacking with Swift


## [The Ultimate Course to Making Professional iOS Apps](https://github.com/CypherPoet/WalletKeeper)

<div style="text-align: left;">
  <img src="./assets/images/ultimate-course-to-ios-development.gif" width="300px"/>
</div>

_A course by [@matteom](https://github.com/matteom) that goes from design to the implementation of a fully functioning app &mdash; focusing heavily on best practices for architecture that are commonly missed_.



For this course, I built a basic "WalletKeeper" app that allowed users to register different Bitcoin wallets and add transactions to them.

I used it as an opportunity to explore building a navigation flow with coordinators, and designing view controllers to be composed through dependency injection so they weren't directly concerned with initializing things like table view data sources, model controllers, state controllers, view models, etc.

# ‚ö°Ô∏è Production Apps

_These are apps that I personally designed, developed, and shipped_.

# ‚öóÔ∏è Miscellaneous Labs, Projects, & Experiments

## Swift Reusable Vault

_A collection of personal extensions that I've found to be highly reusable across projects_.


## Swift Wonderland

_A grab-bag of apps I created to experiment and learn different parts of the Apple ecosystem_.


## SwiftUI Lab

_I dove into SwiftUI as soon as it was announced at WWDC 2019 and I've been having a blast with it since. Given that it's only supported on iOS 13 and up, I'm patient about using it for everything üôÇ &mdash; but I'm continuously looking for ways I can integrate it into new projects._


## [Refactoring Massive View Controllers](https://github.com/CypherPoet/refactoring-massive-view-controllers)

_Project to follow along with the Hacking with Swift [tutorial on refactoring massive view controllers](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/159/how-to-refactor-massive-view-controllers)._


## [Learning Coordinators](https://github.com/CypherPoet/LearningCoordinators)

_A basic app to demonstrate the iOS coordinator pattern -- including the usage of coordinators with a tab bar controller_.
