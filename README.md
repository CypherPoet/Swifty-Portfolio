# Swifty Portfolio

A few years ago, after 5+ years of Web Development, I made the leap into Swift and Apple-platforms development.

This repo is meant to showcase the substrates of those skillz (so far).

If you're looking for an experienced, remote-based, entrepreneurial software engineer who's been diving deep into SwiftUI and Combine since they were released, and freelancing with a number of iOS and React Native development teams over the past few years (and who welcomes being paid in Bitcoin üôÇ), please feel free to [reach out](mailto:CypherPoet@gmail.com) ‚úåÔ∏è.

As someone who also [does graphic art and UI\/UX design](https://linktr.ee/CypherPoet), I can be integrated with any of those needs as well.

# ‚ö°Ô∏è Production Apps

_These are apps that I personally designed, developed, and shipped_.

## [Satoshi VS](https://cypherpoet.github.io/SatoshiVS-iOS/)

Built with SwiftUI to visualize the value of Satoshis against a wide selection of other currencies.

# üéì Projects and Code from Courses

_GitHub repositories for projects, playgrounds, and notes made while following along with various courses._

- [100 Days of SwiftUI & Combine](https://github.com/CypherPoet/100-days-of-swiftui)
  - Throughout this course, I was really able to refine the way I architect SwiftUI/Combine apps with Redux-style data flows alongside MVVM-style ObservableObjects for views.
- [100 Days of Swift](https://github.com/CypherPoet/100-days-of-swift)
  - Similar to 100 Days of SwiftUI, but for UIKit, as the course progressed, I continued refining the way I architect apps with Coordinator-based data flows alongside MVVM-style ViewModels and model controllers for views.
